INVESTMENT IDEAS\nPortly telcos\nTelecom stocks trying to slalom through tough conditions while carrying\na few extra pounds of debt\n\nBy Dave Sterman, equity research columnist\n\nTelecom bankruptcies have been making headlines for most of the last\nyear. Struggling upstarts that borrowed too much money had to fold up\nshop as the cash ran out and creditors came knocking. But debt\nproblems of another sort are cropping up for much larger telecom firms.\nThese companies are not candidates for bankruptcy, but staggering debt\nloads may hinder their operational flexibility and could even cause them\nto radically scale back their businesses. For equity investors, the\nsituation certainly bears watching.\n\nClick here to read more.\nhttp://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=5628&nd=0108\n\n\n2. INVESTMENT IDEAS\nHow the survivors have evolved\nFrom passive transaction-based units to active technology providers and,\nultimately, proselytizers\n\nBy Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer\n\nAt the beginning of 2001, eMarketer selected five so-called \"independent\nexchanges\" that we believed were worth watching during the course of\nthe year. Chosen for the diversity of their vertical industry operations,\nthese benchmark exchanges were noted as useful indicators of the\nsuccess or failure of online exchange-based trade within various\nindustries.\nKnown as a pioneer within the energy industry and among business-to-\nbusiness (B2B) exchanges in general, Altra Market Place was placed on\nthe list because of its background as a facilitator of commodity-based\ntrade. Citadon has long emphasized its Web-based, collaborative\nsoftware for the engineering and building industry, while eMerge\nInteractive (EMRG) was initially known as a cattle broker with extensive\nonline and offline trading operations.\nMetalSite was selected because of its presence within the highly-\ncompetitive online steel-trading industry, and SciQuest (SQST) was\nnoted for its leadership as a provider of Internet-based catalog and\ntrading technology for the life sciences industry.\n\nClick here to read more.\nhttp://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=5720&nd=0108\n\n\nWORD FROM OUR SPONSOR\n--------------------------\n\nFirst Baby of the New Year Looks to be Science & Technology Funds\n\nAs the new year began, technology funds seem to be off to a roaring\nstart.

Find out who has exerted the power in 2001 at:\nhttp://nww1.com/go/ad221.html\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nToday's focus: Storage resolutions\n\nBy Anne Skamarock\n\nMost of us are resolving not make the same mistakes we did last\nyear. In that vein, let me be so bold as to suggest several New\nYear's resolutions for IT management regarding storage and\nmanagement of that storage.\n\n1. I resolve to actively deter all thought of IT being merely a\n   cost center and promote the value of the IT organization as a\n   vital part of the business revenue stream.\n\nInformation is key to business. Efficient management of that\ninformation and the applications that utilize it transforms IT\nfrom a cost center that must be maintained into a vital part of\nthe revenue chain.\n\n2. I will not buy one more gigabyte of storage until I have a\n   complete understanding of the capacity I currently have as well\n   as the data stored therein.\n\nWith the drop in cost of disks, it has become easy to \"just\nthrow more storage at the problem.\" Of course, most of us have\nlearned that the storage is, relatively speaking, the easy\npart. It's the ripple effect that's strangling IT today:\n\nMore storage = More data = Longer backup windows + More\npersonnel = Higher costs\n\nBeing proactive within IT means understanding the current\nenvironment and both current and future requirements. To\nunderstand the current environment, look to storage resource\nmanagement (SRM) software available today from companies like\nSun, WQuinn, or NTP Software. These can discover and report on\nyour current storage capacity. Some of the more sophisticated\nSRM tools can tell you where data duplication is occurring and\nflag specified file types.\n\n3. Once I have an understanding of the current storage\n   environment, I will develop a comprehensive strategy to manage\n   the storage, the data and the people using and managing that\n   storage.\n\nUnderstanding the environment is the first step toward\nproactive management. The second step is to have a plan. Many\nSRM tools provide trend information to help evaluate capacity\nrun-rates and allow for better planning.\n\nHowever, capacity is only one of the costs associated with\nstorage management. Personnel performing tasks like\nprovisioning, backup and recovery are part of the costs of\nrunning the business. Once there is a plan for storage growth,\nit's easier to assign people to the tasks.\n\nFinally, any storage strategy must include policies that direct\nuser behaviors. Being a user myself, without limits I will\nconsume all available storage. It's not because I'm evil (some\nmay challenge that statement); it's because I am not forced to\nmanage my own capacity. Also, SRM software can help determine\nif users are downloading MP3 files and also can show if there\nis massive duplication of certain files.\n\n4. I understand that the data stored on those many disk drives\n   is one of my company's most important resources that must be\n   protected from human error, hardware failure, both internal and\n   external attacks (from viruses, hackers and disgruntled\n   employees) and catastrophes. I resolve to create a data\n   protection strategy that spans my business.\n\nWhat is the survivability of my business if data are lost? This\nis the question we all must ask ourselves. Every company will\nanswer this differently and will formulate different plans.\nCompanies such as StorageNetworks and SunGard provide offsite\nbackup and recovery for companies that require this level of\nprotection but don't want to develop and run their own offsite\nfacilities. With bandwidth prices dropping, there has never\nbeen a better time to consider these options. Even if you don't\nhave the money for automatic offsite recovery, it is prudent\nfor every business to put together a data protection strategy,\nstarting with regular backups.\n\n5. I will investigate solutions beyond those available from my\n   server vendor if for no other reason than to validate the\n   solution my server vendor has recommended.\n\nOur market data suggest that most storage and storage\nmanagement products continue to be purchased from server\nvendors. This is understandable, as it simplifies the many\nchoices and gives IT management one throat to choke when things\ngo wrong. However, there are many storage hardware and storage\nmanagement software companies today that can provide broader\nstorage capabilities than server vendors can. Understanding\nthose capabilities and the tradeoffs of going strictly with a\nserver vendor allow you to make informed decisions.\n\nWith these five suggestions for managing storage, I bid you all\na successful and prosperous New Year!\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nTo contact Anne Skamarock:\n\nAnne Skamarock is an analyst with Enterprise Management\nAssociates (http://www.enterprisemanagement.com).

The assumptions are numerous to list here -- so I list below only the major ones.\n1.  Underlyings in Natgas with a flat term structure -- $ 3.0 per MMBtu\n2.  A reasonable volatility term structure has been assumed\n3.  A representative set of 20 counterparties of various credit ratings selected on the basis of their MTM position on a random day this year.\n4. The reported capital required is for a month and so is the VAR number\n5. The volumetric exposure for each counterparty was assumed to be proportional to the MTM position on the same date as in item3.\n6. We started with a premise of zero MTM, zero collateral at the starting time  and zero threshold for margin calls all through.\n7. The volume is distributed evenly between financial and physical contracts and across 60 forward months\n8. No distinction has been made between physical and financial contracts\n9. The margin calls are assumed to be a function of the exposure times a factor which varies from 0 to 1 as credit rating goes from AAA to D\n\nThe results are therefore ....\n1.  the unnormalized results illustrate the trend of capital required with the volume multiplier but the absolute magnitude of the capital required is tied to the simulated VAR and hence to the underlying volume level assumed.\n\nIf you have anymore questions please feel to call Karthik Rajan, Tanya Tamarchenko or myself.\n\nRegards,\nRabi De\n\n "

"\nI thought that I had cc'd you on this email.  I have not heard a response from Louise -- this was sent this past Thursday evening.  \n\nMrha\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMrha, Jean  \nSent:\tThursday, May 31, 2001 8:32 PM\nTo:\tKitchen, Louise\nCc:\tSchoppe, Tammie\nSubject:\tDissolution of Production Offshore\nImportance:\tHigh\n\n\nLouise,\n\nI hope that everything is well with you.  Much has happened during the past two weeks and I will try to be as brief as possible.\n\nBased on conversations and internal decisions that have occurred, Tom Byargeon and myself have decided to dissolve Production Offshore by the end of second quarter.  I have spoken with John regarding this commercial structural change and have also renegotiated the 2001 Upstream Products expected margin to $30 MM.  (The expected budget from Production Offshore was $20 MM out of the $50 MM for Upstream Products.)\nI have attached a document that Tom has drafted outlining the remaining project responsibilities, market representation, and personnel redeployment.\n\nThe following individuals within Production Offshore have yet to be redeployed :\n\n1. Tom Byargeon - He has been offered an opportunity to work with Randy Maffett, Vice President - Wholesale Origination, EGM.  Tom also will be meeting with Dave Duran tomorrow morning to discuss opportunities that exist within Generation Investments or Northeast Power Origination. \n\n In addition, I want him to consider leading the Ecommerce/ Producer One effort for Upstream Products.  I desperately need a dedicated senior commercial person with contract negotiations expertise that can also see the financing opportunities that exist for Producer segment (i.e., wellhead connects, metering and monitoring equipment, etc.) through a Producer One transaction.  However, Tom has surmised that higher commercial visibility will be achieved by working on the financing of large asset deals within EGM or perhaps, in Duran's group.  I have assured him that the commercialization of the back and mid office is just as important if not more important to Enron's upper management.  Plus, I feel the closing of these outsourcing transactions will be more numerous by the end of the year than the other origination opportunities offered.\n\nI know that he greatly respects your opinion.  If you could contact him (x30650) or drop him an email with your commercial perspective, I am sure that the correspondence would be greatly appreciated. \n\n2. Kevin Miller - mostly likely will focus on marketing and closing Producer ecommerce transactions.  In addition, Kevin has a very strong crude and processing background.  This experience would complement the Producer One effort as well support the processing needs of the Wellhead desk.  He could have career opportunities with EGM, but overall, is very enthusiastic about ENA's Producer ecommerce commercial platform.\n\n3. Kenn Loch - has a very technical background suited for deepwater projects.  Since the responsibility for Mariner is within ECR, Allan Keel may be interested in his background.  Also, since the responsibility for the MEGS/Pluto deal should be transferred to ECR,  Kenn would be an appropriate resource for that transaction as well.\n\n4. Lisa Druzbik -  is very familiar with the accounting details behind MEGS/ Pluto.  Has opportunities are within ECR and EES.  Most of her background is within the E&P sector.\n\nI have spoken with Scott Josey about the impending dissolution of Production Offshore.  Since MEGS/Pluto is a deal with Mariner (and since Enron owns 97% of Mariner, the deal is analogous to doing a transaction with oneself), he concurs with me that the transaction should be evaluated with the overall restructure or potential sale of Mariner.  Should I transfer over to ECR all 2001 capital charges and associated earnings related to MEGS/Pluto?  Should this transfer occur as of the beginning of the year or at the end of second quarter? The YTD margin associated with this project is approximately $ 3 MM.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nRegards, Mrha\n\n "

"As described in my August 22 e-mail, FERC has issued a NOPR proposing revised public utility filing requirements.  A copy of my Aug. 22 summary is attached for your reference.  I've discussed this with Elizabeth Sager and Harlan Murphy in ENA Legal, and the following is a very brief summary of aspects of the NOPR that we think Enron should consider opposing.  Comments are due Oct. 5.\n\nIf approved, FERC's proposed revisions would affect Enron by requiring electronic posting of certain transactional data by power marketers and entities selling at wholesale pursuant to market-based rate authority.\n\nCurrently, EPMI (and gencos with market-based rate authority) must file the following information quarterly:\n\n\t- identification of the buyer/seller;\n\t- description of the service, (e.g., purchase/sale, firm/non-firm); \n\t- delivery point(s); \n\t- price(s) (price per transaction rather than price ranges) \n\t- quantities, (e.g., MWh/MW); and \n\t- dates/duration of service (e.g., daily, monthly, hourly, etc.) \nSuch information is supposed to be reported on a transaction by transaction (rather than aggregated) basis.  The quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment.\nThe quarterly filing requirements proposed in the NOPR differ in that they would, 1) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt; 2) require electronic posting of an Index of Customers rather than paper filing and 3) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs.  Enron should consider objecting to these revisions.  I've spoken with some of the traders and they agree.  The effect of these requirements would be that Enron's competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction.  FERC has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements.  \nENA Legal representatives and I will be participating in the EPSA conference call to discuss the NOPR on Friday.  I would like to have a consensus on Enron's general position by then.  I do not know whether we will be joining EPSA's comments or filing on our own.  Please let me know your thoughts and call me if you would like to discuss.  Also, if you don't already have information on the EPSA conference call and want to participate, let me know and I can provide you with the call-in number and agenda.\nSSL\n\n "
