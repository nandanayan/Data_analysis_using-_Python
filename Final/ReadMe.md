# DATA ANALYSIS 1: Using philadelphiacrimedata dataset.

In this analysis we will find  number of crimes happend per year,per month and by days.

Graph describes the crime incidents on day basis. This graph clearly shows us that number of crimes are more in summer than any other season. If you see year wise the rate of crimes are decreasing.

# lets do analysis on how crime rates are changing in Police-districts in every year:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25697215/25309478/574d9ed8-279c-11e7-90f8-808699c82814.png)

It is evident that places with police stations the number of crimes have dropped down. But there are few instances the rate also increased.

# Now, lets find how the crime rates change for each crime type!

# 
Lets deep drill how the crime rate changes each month for every year!!

Again summer is in the hit list. If you combine this observation with the text general-code graphs----> It is evident that the all forms of crimes are going high in the summer time frame when compared to the winter or any other time frame .

We have a conclusion that summer is the hit time for majority of crimes in all the years. Now further deep drill down the x axis co ordinates to timestamp. Which means finding the rate of crimes on hourly basis for all the years.

FOr all the years it is clear that crime rates are less in 3.00pm to 7.00pm timestamps.
If you take in 2006 and 2015, the crime rate at mid night hours has been drastically dropeed down.Which a good sign. there would have been proper actions from running governments.


# Data Analysis 2: 

Focusing on causes for crimes with Crime Type, longitude and latitude as parameter considerations. Lets find the total count per month.

From the above findings, lets deep drill how these causes resulting in crimes trending in Police departmental districts.

Lets further deep drill the data by finding how these causes that are effecting the crimes are varying acrcoss different years

Conclusion: For every crime there is a cause. There are few crime incidents like Theft of vehicle that are constanly taking place in all the time frames and seasons. This analysis will help us to monitor few channels that will help us in reducing the crime rate.

# Data Analysis 3:
Deeper Analysis on Bulglary Resedential.
In this case we are taking one Crime type.. Say Bulglary Resedential.

This Graph shows number of Crime Incidents related to Bulglary Resedential for different Years.

Now, Lets consider this for different Police districts.

Here we are able to do analysis one Text_General_code.In this case it is Burglary Resedential. You can compare how these crime trends change for different Dc_Dist codes in different years. It is evident that crimes related to Burglary Resedential are almost constant for different Dc_dist codes and years. There must a proper channel to monitor this crimes. It looks like Crimes related to this are constantly taking place !!

# Data Analysis 4 and 5:
# Data Analysis On Crime Incidents Of Chicago:

lets find number of crimes types and count of each of the type.
top 10 crime incidents in this time frame for chicago!

find number of incidents that have taken place in a particular location description!
lets graph red zoned locations where there is a probability of crime rate is very high!

lets find monthly crimes that took place from 2012 to 2016 in chicago
#plot a graph for monthly crime rate findings in time frame 2012 to 2016!
plotting a heath map for graphical presentations of monthly crimes

from matrix plot we can make 2 conclusions: 2012 and 2013 are highest crime victimed years june and july are highest crime incidents months in all the years

May, June, July and August are highest crime activities months in 2012 and 2013
#On an average these four months are highest crime incident months from 2012 to 2017!!

lets do analysis on no:of arrests taken place frpm 2012 to 2016!
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25697215/25309723/8131433e-27a2-11e7-8316-13c27ccde324.png)

#from above matrix we can see that arrests were highest from 2012 to 2014. 
#And there was a trend in decrease number of areests from from 2012 to 2017.
#Here we have a scope of assumption that crime incidents would have probably dropped down from 2012 to 2017.! Five year period there is drop in crime rate. 

#To support above statements we will visualize the arrest VS crime rate graphs.

Conclusion From the graph above there is clear evidence that there is decrese in crime rate from 2012 to 2017---->as a result there is drop in arrest rate too.
Another point to be taken note here is there is around 2,00,000 difference in crimes and number of arrests. May be the government would have taken more effective measures in handling crime incidents.
If we see the plot most crimes happen from May-August----> may be this is because its summer time and people would be on vacations more chances of attacks.
