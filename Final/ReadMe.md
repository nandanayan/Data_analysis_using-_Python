In this analysis we will find  number of crimes happend per year,per month and by days.

It is evident that places with police stations the number of crimes have dropped down. But there are few instances the rate also increased.

# Now, lets find how the crime rates change for each crime type!

Again summer is in the hit list. If you combine this observation with the text general-code graphs----> It is evident that the all forms of crimes are going high in the summer time frame when compared to the winter or any other time frame .

We have a conclusion that summer is the hit time for majority of crimes in all the years. Now further deep drill down the x axis co ordinates to timestamp. Which means finding the rate of crimes on hourly basis for all the years.

FOr all the years it is clear that crime rates are less in 3.00pm to 7.00pm timestamps.
If you take in 2006 and 2015, the crime rate at mid night hours has been drastically dropeed down.Which a good sign. there would have been proper actions from running governments.
